1) Resolution
    Resolution refers to the total number of pixels on a screen,
    typically given as width × height (e.g., 1920×1080).
    This metric indicates how much detail the screen can display, with higher resolutions offering more detail.
    Some common resolutions include:

        HD (High Definition): 1280×720
        Full HD (FHD): 1920×1080
        Quad HD (QHD): 2560×1440
        Ultra HD (UHD/4K): 3840×2160

2) Screen Density
    Screen Density (also known as pixel density or PPI - pixels per inch) measures the number of pixels
    in a given physical area of the screen.
    It is calculated based on the resolution and the size of the screen.
    Higher screen density means more pixels per inch, resulting in sharper and clearer images.
    Some examples of screen density classifications include:

        LDPI (Low Density): ~120 PPI
        MDPI (Medium Density): ~160 PPI
        HDPI (High Density): ~240 PPI
        XHDPI (Extra High Density): ~320 PPI
        XXHDPI (Extra Extra High Density): ~480 PPI
        XXXHDPI (Extra Extra Extra High Density): ~640 PPI


3) Density-Independent Pixels (dp or dip)
   Density-independent pixels (dp or dip) are a unit of measurement used in Android development
   to ensure that user interface (UI) elements are displayed
   consistently across different devices with varying screen densities.
   The concept of dp helps create a more uniform appearance for apps by abstracting away the underlying pixel density.


4) Screen Size
   Screen size refers to the physical dimensions of a display, typically measured diagonally from one corner to the
   opposite corner. It is an important specification for various devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops,
   monitors, and televisions. The measurement is given in inches and gives an idea of the display's real-world size.
